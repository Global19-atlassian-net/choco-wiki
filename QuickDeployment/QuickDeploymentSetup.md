# Quick Deployment Environment Setup

This document contains instructions for importing the QuickDeploy appliance/VM, or creating a VM and attaching the QuickDeploy disk image to it.
You will receive a download link via email for an archive of the VM image. Once you have this downloaded, it will be ready for extraction and import into your environment.

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> Please follow these steps in ***exact*** order. These will be very important later when you are trying to use the environment.

## Step 0: Setup Considerations

The following are points to keep in mind during initial setup:

* You will need access to AWS to download the environment (specifically `s3.amazonaws.com`).
* Hostname/FQDN changes will invalidate all scripts and certificates.
  Thus, if you plan to change the hostname, you must do so prior to running any setup scripts.
  If you run into issues, refer to the README file on the desktop of the VM.
* Self-signed certificates are generated by default.
  If you plan to use your own certificates, please reach out to Support for assistance.
* The back-end database is configured with no outbound connections - if you plan to change this, please reach out to Support for assistance.
* If you intend to use Nexus outside of your corporate network without the use of a VPN, you will be required to configure RBAC on the repositories housed inside of the repository server.
  This is to ensure that the packages stored on the server are not publicly accessible without authentication.


### Step 0.1: QDE Rename Considerations

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> tl;dr: Think long and hard before changing the QDE hostname
>
> Renaming the QDE host requires a lot of things and needs to be completed FIRST prior to ANYTHING that is done on the QDE box. It is strongly recommended **NOT** to rename unless you absolutely need to. The most important reason has to do with how a client installs from QDE - it must learn to trust the QDE certificate. Once renamed, the easy option that's provided for you goes away and you will need to provide a hosted solution with an already trusted certificate.
> You can provide your own certificate that is already trusted on machines as part of the [[SSL/TLS Setup|QuickDeploymentSslSetup]]. Your other option is to host the script to trust the certificate with an already trusted certificate. You will find a template that you will need to edit at `c:\choco_setup_files` (in the QDE) named `Import-ChocoServerCertificate.ps1`.
>
> Please contact support if you need help here.

If you rename the QDE Environment, here's a small list of things you'll need to do:

1. Update scripts in Nexus that are currently pointed to the default QDE name.
1. Regenerate SSL Certificates
1. Deploy the Nexus SSL Certificate public key to the clients (there is a helper method that is used if the box is not renamed and is limited to that name for security purposes). See `c:\choco_setup_files\Import-ChocoServerCertificate.ps1` for an example of what we mean.
1. There may be more places impacted. Check with support to ensure all is good to go.

## Step 1: Import Virtual Environment

Chooose one of the following methods for what your hypervisor environment supports.

### Platform: Hyper-V (Appliance)

1. Download zip archive containing the Hyper-V VM directory structure, and unzip it to the directory you wish to store it in.
2. Open Hyper-V Manager, and select `Import Virtual Machine` from the right sidebar (or  Action menu), and choose the folder you extracted from the above archive (e.g. ChocoServer).
3. Increase the size of the VHD, for example, to 100GB. Increase to what you feel comfortable with.

```powershell
Resize-VHD -Path C:\path\to\QuickDeploy Environment.vhd -SizeInBytes 100GB
```

4. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 version of Hyper-V now come with built-in support for Hyper-V Integration Services, as they automatically get pushed to guest VM's.
   In older versions of Hyper-V, you should see an option to "Insert Integration Services Setup Disk".
   You can use this option to install and enable Hyper-V Integration Services.

### Platform: Hyper-V (VHD file)

1. Download VHD from provided link, and unzip it to the directory you wish to store it in.
2. Increase the size of the VHD, for example to 100GB. Increase to what you feel comfortable with.

```powershell
Resize-VHD -Path C:\path\to\QuickDeploy Environment.vhd -SizeInBytes 100GB
```

3. Open Hyper-V Manager.
4. Create a new VM.
5. If prompted, choose a `Generation 1` virtual machine option.
6. Set startup memory to `8192 MB` (you can specify this later as well).
7. When asked to create a new disk or use an existing one, select the `Use existing virtual disk` option and browse to the VHD you unzipped in Step 1.
8. Adjust the hardware specifications of the VM. For a performant system, the following are recommended:
    - 4 vCPUs
    - 8 GB RAM
9. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 version of Hyper-V now come with built-in support for Hyper-V Integration Services, as they automatically get pushed to guest VM's.
   In older versions of Hyper-V, you should see an option to `Insert Integration Services Setup Disk`.
   You can use this option to install and enable Hyper-V Integration Services.

### Platform: VMware (VMDK file)

1. Download VMDK from provided link, and unzip it to the directory you wish to store it.
2. For ESX/ESXi, open vSphere and upload the downloaded VMDK to your datastore.
3. Create a new VM.
4. When prompted for OS type, choose `Windows Server 2019` (if available), or `Windows Server 2016 or later`.
5. If prompted for boot firmware, choose `Legacy BIOS` (**not** UEFI).
6. When asked to create a new disk or attach, delete the default disk, select attach, and browse to the VMDK you uploaded.
7. Adjust the hardware specifications of the VM. For a performant system, the following are recommended:
    - 4 vCPUs
    - 8 GB RAM
8. Once you click Finish, go back into the `Edit settings` context menu for the VM, and expand the disk you attached to 100GB (double-check in OS, and extend if needed).
8. Boot up VM, and Install VMware Tools using the console menus (this will require a reboot).

### Platform: VMware (OVF template)

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> The OVF import method can be tricky. Unless you have the **exact** same network settings as the host where the OVF was exported, you will likely run into failures on attempts to import it. You _could_ workaround this by creating your own VM first, exporting the OVF file, using the Network settings from this file to replace the 2 sections of Network settings in the OVF of QDE, and then attempt to import the OVF for QDE. However, we realize this process is cumbersome, and would **strongly** advise you utilize the VMDK import method above for greatest compatibility. We are working to improve this process, but as of right now, the OVF method is to be used at your own risk.

1. Download OVF file and unzip it to the directory you wish to store it.
2. Review instructions for deploying a VM from an OVF file [here](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.0/com.vmware.vsphere.html.hostclient.doc/GUID-FBEED81C-F9D9-4193-BDCC-CC4A60C20A4E_copy.html).
3. Adjust settings of newly imported VM to our recommended:
    - 4 vCPUs
    - 8 GB RAM
4. Install VMWare Tools on the VM once booted (this will require a reboot).

### Platform: Other

Most likely you are going to download the VMDK file and convert it to your platform. Please reach out to support to see what options are available.

## Step 2: Other Considerations for Virtual Environment

### Step 2.1: DNS Settings

The QDE environment is configured by default to use DHCP for easier initial setup.
You will likely need to reconfigure it with a static IP address depending on your organization's policies.

___
## Step 3: Virtual Environment Setup

On the desktop of your QDE VM, there is a `Readme.html` file, that will guide you through the rest of the setup process once you are logged in.
A version of this readme file can be found in the [[Quick Deployment Desktop Readme|QuickDeploymentDesktopReadme]].

> :memo: **NOTE**: The online version is likely more up to date than the ReadMe you will find on the desktop (not including redacted items like credentials). If there are conflicts between the desktop readme and what you see online, prefer the online version.

> :warning: **WARNING**: If you have an existing corporate environment you will be servicing with the QDE VM, be sure to perform your organization-specific initial configuration **_before_** running setup scripts.

### Step 3.1: Add License File to QDE
In the [[Quick Deployment Desktop Readme|QuickDeploymentDesktopReadme]], it is going to ask you to use the license file. That license file comes from an external location. It is best to copy/paste the file into QDE as a whole file, but you may have needed to set up any kind of extensions available for that.

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> If you find that you need to copy the text and paste the license file text into a new file in QDE, the file format and name is extremely important to get right. If you don't have UTF-8 or there is a space inserted, Chocolatey will consider it invalid.
> Please contact support if you need help here.

### Step 3.2: Regenerate SSL Certificates

See [[QDE SSL/TLS Setup|QuickDeploymentSslSetup]].

### Step 3.3: Database Password Changes (Optional)

The database credentials are currently pre-set.
If you would like to change the credentials associated with the database, you will need to follow these steps.

1. Change the database access credentials
2. Reinstall the chocolatey-management-service package

```powershell
choco uninstall chocolatey-management-service -y
choco install chocolatey-management-service -y --package-parameters-sensitive=”’/ConnectionString=””Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=ChocolateyManagement;User ID=ChocoUser;Password=NewPassword;””’”
```

3. Reinstall the chocolatey-management-web package

```powershell
choco uninstall chocolatey-management-web -y
Choco install chocolatey-management-web -y --package-parameters-sensitive=”’/ConnectionString=””Server=Localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=ChocolateyManagement;User ID=ChocoUser;Password=NewPassword;””’”
```
