If you are not a customer yet, you can [reach out for a trial](https://chocolatey.org/contact/trial).

> Trials are limited to organizations. If you are personally wanting to work with CCM and other C4B components, you can purchase a C4B starter pack - see [pricing](https://chocolatey.org/pricing).
