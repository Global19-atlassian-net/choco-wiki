## Unable to use Chocolatey GUI extension with Chocolatey GUI v0.17.1

Some business customers have reported an issue when attempting to use version `0.1.0-alpha-20200402` of the Chocolatey GUI extension (a pre-release version of the extension) in combination with Chocolatey GUI v0.17.1.

This issue was tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI/issues/785) and a fix was released in Chocolatey GUI v0.17.2.

If you are running into any issues with using the Chocolatey GUI extension alongside Chocolatey GUI, please ensure that you are using at least Chocolatey GUI v0.17.2 and also using the latest pre-release version of Chocolatey GUI extension which is currently `0.1.0-GL-4-20200713`.
